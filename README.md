# Simon-Game
Simple pattern recongition/memorization game that has a user press a keyboard key to start the game, then they have to remember what color button was added to the pattern, but keeping in mind the previous iterations of the pattern as well, e.g. if currently green button is added to the pattern and the pattern preceding this was Yellow, Green, Yellow, then the current solution would be Yellow, Green, Yellow, and then Green.
